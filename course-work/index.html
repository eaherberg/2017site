		<p>For my first course sample, I am sharing a PowerPoint presentation I designed for my EDLPS 580: The American College and University class. The group project focused on the Samuel E. Kelley Ethnic Cultural Center at the University of Washington, and the extent to which the Center is inclusive to all UW students. The PowerPoint theme was designed by me, and demonstrated my commitment to designing visually stimulating presentations to engage audiences.</p>

		<p>For my third course sample, I chose to share the marketing plan I created for EDLPS 598E: Marketing in Higher Education. For this particular project, I was able to take full creative freedom in designing a marketing plan for a fictional college, which aimed to increase their campuses diversity. The document was designed by me, and demonstrates my ability to design a template that stakeholders will find attractive and easy to navigate.</p>
